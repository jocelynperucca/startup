  "description": "Whether you have just moved out to go to college, just gotten married, or whatever it may be, there always seems to arise challenges when living with one or more people! Working out what needs to get done whether that be groceries, chores, events, or other to-do items, and especially how quickly they need to get done is just one of those. With *PrioriTask*, a group of 2 or more people can add items that need to get done and how high of a priority it is with a three-level system (low, medium, high) that will display the items from highest to lowest. As each person in the group adds tasks, they will appear on the other members lists so that any person can do and mark them off when done. With this system, no task will be forgotten and will **assure** that everyones needs are seen! <br/>",
