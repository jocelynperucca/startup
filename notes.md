## GITHUB
I learned that visual code works very well with Github in order to `git pull`, `git push`, and `git commit` changes. ***It's essential to only make changes on one environment in order to avoid merges conflits***
The use of git bash is also very useful for **cloning** repositories, but make sure you are in the *correct directory*
See [README](README.md)
