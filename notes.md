## GITHUB
I learned that visual code works very well with Github in order to `git pull`, `git push`, and `git commit` changes. ***It's essential to only make changes on one environment in order to avoid merges conflits***
The use of git bash is also very useful for **cloning** repositories, but make sure you are in the *correct directory*
See [README](README.md)
## AWS EC2
- My IP Address is http://52.6.5.201/
- In order to ssh into my portal I need to remember this command
âžœ  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address] in which my key pair is stored in my CS 260 folder
## Caddy
Caddy handles all of the creation and rotation of web certificates so that we can easily support HTTPS
- Configuration file : ~/Caddyfile
    - This contatins the definitions for routing HTTP requests. to determine the location where static HTML files are loaded from and proxy requests. You shouldn't have to modify it
- HTML files ~/pulblic_html
    - This is the directory of files that Caddy serves up when reuqests are made to the root or your web server. It will look for the file in your directory.
## HTTPS and TLS
HTTPS stands for Secure Hypertext TRansport Protocol. TLS is sometimes called SSL.
- the -v parameter shows the verbose output of the HTTPS exchange. The > /dev/null redirection throws away the actual HTTP response, since we only care about the negotiation, by redirecting the output to the null device.
- HTTPS normally runs on 433 while HTTP is one 80. TCP does flow control and makes the connection reliable
## HTML
- You always want to call your top level **"index.html"**.
- There are 3 levels, Header, Body/Content, and Footer. **Make sure to include in your FOOTER a link to your github repository.**
- Use the deployment script after you've done al you want with your key, server, and name of files in order to get it to your actual server you made. It will be different for each technology.
- ./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s simon
## CSS
Cascading Style Sheets change sections of HTML for stylistic measures. It defines rules for certain selectors. </br>
![CSS](/cssDefinitions.jpg) </br>
You can do css for sections like:
- p
- header
- li
- h2
- td
- classes like
    - #table (whatever class you assign it.)
    - section class="fly-in"

Some things you might change are:
- background-color
- width or height
- list-style
- color (can be used with keywords, or RGB hex/function, or hsl if you're wanting crazy hue saturation and light)
- text-align
- border
- padding (usually followed by **1em**)
- font-size (many different units of measurement for that) You can also import fonts from other websites.
- and many others

You can also do Animations! Depends on the animation name but you would do somethiong like: <animation-name: demo;animation-duration: 3s;>
- @Keyframes are for key points and then CSS will do smooth transitions. For example: </br>

< @keyframes demo {
  from {
    font-size: 0vh;
  }

  95% {
    font-size: 21vh;
  }

  to {
    font-size: 20vh;
  }
} >
